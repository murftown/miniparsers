MINIPARSERS

Small, simple atomic parsers that do valuable things with data

bratch.py: uses [square brackets] as a nestable delimiter to produce structure out of a flat file
tabby.py: uses tab intention as a nestable delimiter to produce structure out of a flat file
tabby_py24.py: same things as tabby, but compatible with Python2.4 (some syntactic sugar unfurled into manual code)
    Also less likely to be up to date than tabby.py
