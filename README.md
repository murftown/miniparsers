# Miniparsers #

Small, simple atomic parsers that do valuable things with data

* bratch.py: uses [square brackets] as a nestable delimiter to produce structure out of a flat file
* tabby.py: uses tab intention as a nestable delimiter to produce structure out of a flat file
* tabby_py24.py: same things as tabby, but compatible with Python2.4 (some syntactic sugar unfurled into manual code).  Less likely to be up to date than tabby.py

### Usage Terms ###
Use it in any way that helps you!  Except I don't want you to use it to rip people off or deceive people, that's not cool!
